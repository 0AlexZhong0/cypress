      ## if we're still hovering, revert the dom
      ##
      ## 2. when we hover off a command, wait 50 ms
      ## and if we are still in a non 'reverting' state
      ## meaning we have moused over nothing instead
      ## of a different command, then restore the dom
      ## to the original
      ##
      ## this prevents heavy CPU usage when hovering
      ## up and down over commands. it also prevents
      ## restoring to the original through all of that.
      ## additionally when quickly moving your mouse
      ## over many commands, unless you're hovered for
      ## 50ms, it wont revert at all. so we optimize
