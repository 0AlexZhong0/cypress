Cypress is a test engine that runs unit and integration tests in your browser.

### What's in this repo?

Currently this repo is used to house all of the issues (from early adopters) and the changelog.

- #### [Changelog](../../wiki/changelog)

- #### [Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)

### Where's the code?

When Cypress releases its public beta, we will open source the code base. This will consist of the `cypress-driver`, the `cypress-gui`, the `cypress-webapp`, the `cypress-server` and all backend adapters.

### How do I get Cypress?

Right now you have to be an early adopter to get a hold of Cypress. Visit [http://www.cypress.io](http://www.cypress.io) and get on our mailing list. We send periodic emails asking for additional adopters until we are ready for a public beta.

The public beta is on track for sometime in 2017.
