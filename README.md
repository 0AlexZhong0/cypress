This repo contains the source code for pushing out [https://example.cypress.io](https://example.cypress.io).

You should not clone this repo. It is used interally.

The actual example repo you're probably looking for is the [kitchen sink app here](https://github.com/cypress-io/examples-kitchen-sink).

## Developing

```bash
npm install
```

This copies the `examples-kitchen-sink` src files here, and they can now be built + pushed.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploying

```bash
npm run deploy
```
