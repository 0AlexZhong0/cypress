{% url 'The Cypress Dashboard' https://on.cypress.io/dashboard %} is a  service we've created that gives you access to recorded tests - typically when running Cypress tests from your {% url 'CI provider' continuous-integration %}. The Dashboard provides you insight into what happened when your tests ran.

# Overview

**The Dashboard allows you to:**

- See the number of failed, pending and passing tests.
- Get the entire stack trace of failed tests.
- View screenshots taken when tests fail and when using {% url `cy.screenshot()` screenshot %}.
- Watch a video of your entire test run or a clip at the point of test failure.
- Manage who has access to your recorded test data.

**See Tests Runs in Desktop**

Additionally we've integrated the test runs into the Cypress {% url 'Desktop Application' installing-cypress %}). This means you can see the test runs in the *Runs* tab from within every project.
