### Update Cypress

Before filing a bug, make sure you are up to date. Your issue may have already been fixed. Even if you do not see the issue described as resolved in a newer version, a newer version may help in the process of debugging your issue by giving more helpful error messages.

You can update Cypress by going to `Settings` > `Check for updates` in the desktop application.

**If you can not update** for some reason, please include the version of Cypress you are running when you file a report. You can find the version in `Settings` > `About` in the desktop application.
