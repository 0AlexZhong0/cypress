The CLI expected to install version: 1.2.3

Instead we will install version: 0.12.1

Note: there is no guarantee these versions will work properly together.

It looks like you've installed Cypress globally.

This will work, but it's not recommended.

The recommended way to install Cypress is as a devDependency per project.

You should probably run these commands:

  - npm uninstall -g cypress
  - npm install --save-dev cypress
