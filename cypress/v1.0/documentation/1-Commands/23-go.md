## [cy.go( *direction* )](#direction-usage)

`cy.go` enables you to navigate back or forward to the previous or next URL in the browser's history.

If going forward or back causes a full page refresh, Cypress will wait for the new page to load before moving on to new commands. Cypress additionally handles situations where a page load was not caused (such as hash routing) and will resolve immediately.

## [cy.go( *number* )](#number-usage)

`cy.go` can navigate back or forward going to the URL within a specific history position (-1 goes back one page, 1 goes forward one page).

If going forward or back causes a full page refresh, Cypress will wait for the new page to load before moving on to new commands. Cypress additionally handles situations where a page load was not caused (such as hash routing) and will resolve immediately.
