excerpt: Why you should test your code.

Since you've landed here, hopefully youâ€™re open to the idea that testing code has some benefits. But, maybe you're still weighing the benefits or maybe you just need some fuel to convince your team that testing is worth looking into. Let's go over just a few reasons why you should be testing your code.

# Invest in testing to:

:fa-code:  **Increase code quality**
Writing tests challenges you think more clearly about edge cases and code for them.

:fa-clock-o:  **Save time**
Less time is spent finding and tracking down bugs when there are tests that fail automatically when bugs are introduced.

:fa-sitemap:  **Decrease code complexity**
Complex code requires being broken into smaller pieces when testing. It also helps you think through how dependencies and input/output is handled.

:fa-wrench:  **Encourage refactoring**
Knowing there are tests surrounding the functionality of your code means you can feel more comfortable playing around and refactoring that code.

:fa-hourglass-start:  **Develop faster**
There is time up front that goes into planning a test strategy, but over time, velocity will increase.

:fa-bug:  **Reduce regression**
Having tests cover your code means that when you add new features, you can see if any existing features behavior changed.

:fa-smile-o:  **Increase confidence**
The risk of breaking code increases as your applications complexity grows. Being able to catch regressions makes it more likely that your changes will not inadvertently break things that used to work.

:fa-file-code-o:  **Self-document**
Test suites cover the expected behavior of your code and are a great documentation reference.
