excerpt: Cypress helps you write automated tests for the web

Cypress is a test engine that runs unit and integration tests in your browser. It aims to reduce the mental effort required to write tests. Cypress works in your typical development workflow (in the browser) and allows you to see your application while it's being tested. This enables you to practice true test driven development since there is no context shift between testing and development.

**Never written tests before?** Check out our [Intro to Unit Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/intro-to-unit-testing) and [Intro to Integration Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/intro-to-integration-testing).
