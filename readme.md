### Getting Started

1. navigate into the installed `eclectus` directory
2. run `npm link` - this will reference the `bin/ecl` globally and you'll now have access to this command everywhere
3. run `gulp` to build the project files and to watch for any changes to JS/HTML/CSS
4. `cd` into your other projects root directory and run `ecl start` to start the eclectus server
5. navigate to `0.0.0.0:3000` in your browser
